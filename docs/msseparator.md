# MSSeparator Parameter Guide

`MSSeparator` is the main Python API entry point for loading a separation model, running inference, and saving separated stems. For catalog models, prefer `MSSeparator.from_model_name(...)`; use the full constructor when you need custom weights, a custom YAML config, or full control over runtime parameters.

## Recommended Entry Point

```python
from pymss import MSSeparator

separator = MSSeparator.from_model_name(
    "bs_roformer_voc_hyperacev2",
    download=True,
    model_dir="models",
    device="auto",
    output_format="wav",
    store_dirs="results",
    inference_params={
        "standardize": None,
        "normalize": False,
    },
)
separator.process_folder("path/to/input_file_or_folder")
```

`from_model_name()` resolves the model type, weight path, and config path from the pymss model catalog, then forwards the remaining keyword arguments to `MSSeparator(...)`.

## `from_model_name()` Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model_name` | `str` | required | Catalog model name, for example `bs_roformer_voc_hyperacev2`. |
| `model_dir` | `str \| None` | `None` | Directory used to find or download model files. When omitted, pymss uses its default model cache location. |
| `download` | `bool` | `False` | If `True`, missing model files are downloaded before loading. If `False`, loading fails when files are missing. |
| `source` | `str` | `"modelscope"` | Download source passed to the model downloader. |
| `endpoint` | `str \| None` | `None` | Optional downloader endpoint override. |
| `**kwargs` | any | - | Forwarded directly to `MSSeparator(...)`, such as `device`, `output_format`, `store_dirs`, `audio_params`, `debug`, and `inference_params`. |

## Constructor

```python
separator = MSSeparator(
    model_type="htdemucs",
    model_path="path/to/model",
    config_path="path/to/config.yaml",
    device="auto",
    device_ids=[0],
    output_format="wav",
    use_tta=False,
    store_dirs="results",
    audio_params={
        "wav_bit_depth": "FLOAT",
        "flac_bit_depth": "PCM_24",
        "mp3_bit_rate": "320k",
        "m4a_bit_rate": "192k",
        "m4a_aac_at_quality": 2,
    },
    logger=None,
    debug=False,
    progress_callback=None,
    inference_params={
        "batch_size": None,
        "overlap_size": None,
        "chunk_size": None,
        "standardize": None,
        "normalize": False,
        "mask_mode": None,
    },
)
```

## Constructor Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model_type` | `str` | required | Model architecture/runtime type. Common values include `bs_roformer`, `mel_band_roformer`, `htdemucs`, `mdx23c`, `bandit`, `bandit_v2`, `scnet`, `apollo`, `vr`, `legacy_demucs`, and `legacy_tasnet`. Catalog users normally do not set this manually. |
| `model_path` | `str` | required | Path to the model weights file. The extension depends on the model family, for example `.ckpt`, `.th`, or `.pth`. |
| `config_path` | `str \| None` | `None` | YAML config path for MSS-style models. If omitted, pymss tries `model_path + ".yaml"`. VR models are loaded from built-in VR metadata and do not use an MSS YAML config. |
| `device` | `str` | `"auto"` | Runtime device. Valid values are `auto`, `cpu`, `cuda`, `mps`, and `mlx`. `auto` chooses CUDA first, then Apple MPS, then CPU. `mlx` is a public shortcut for the Apple Silicon MLX backend and internally runs through `device="mps"` with MLX model settings. |
| `device_ids` | `list[int]` | `[0]` | CUDA device IDs. When more than one CUDA ID is provided, supported Torch models can be wrapped with `torch.nn.DataParallel`. This does not select multiple Apple MPS or MLX devices. |
| `output_format` | `str` | `"wav"` | File format used by `process_folder()` and `save_audio()`. Supported values are `wav`, `flac`, `mp3`, and `m4a`. |
| `use_tta` | `bool` | `False` | Enables test-time augmentation. For MSS models this runs multiple transformed variants and merges the result. It may improve quality slightly, but it increases inference time. |
| `store_dirs` | `str \| dict` | `"results"` | Output destination used by `process_folder()`. A string writes every saved stem to the same folder. A dict maps stem names to a folder, a list of folders, `None`, or an empty value. `None` or a missing stem means that stem is not saved. |
| `audio_params` | `dict` | see below | Encoding options used when saving audio. |
| `logger` | `logging.Logger \| None` | `None` | Logger instance. If omitted, pymss uses `pymss.get_separation_logger()`. |
| `debug` | `bool` | `False` | Enables debug logging and disables some progress bar behavior intended for normal CLI-style output. |
| `progress_callback` | callable \| `None` | `None` | Optional callback used by lower-level demixing code. It receives progress information from long-running inference loops. |
| `inference_params` | `dict` | see below | Runtime inference overrides. Keys are model-dependent. Unsupported keys are rejected by the server validation layer and ignored only when not passed to the relevant runtime path. |

## Output Routing With `store_dirs`

`store_dirs` controls which stems are saved by `process_folder()`.

```python
store_dirs = "results"
```

This writes every stem to `results`.

```python
store_dirs = {
    "vocals": "results/vocals",
    "instrumental": ["results/instrumental", "backup/instrumental"],
    "drums": None,
}
```

This writes `vocals` to one folder, writes `instrumental` to two folders, and skips `drums`. Stem names are matched against the model config instruments. Invalid stem keys are removed during initialization and logged as warnings.

When `inference_params["normalize"]` is enabled, pymss separates all stems that will be saved together so the shared output normalization gain is computed across those stems. If you save only two stems from a six-stem model, those two saved stems are normalized together.

## `audio_params`

`audio_params` is only used when writing files. It does not affect model inference.

| Key | Default | Used by | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `wav_bit_depth` | `"FLOAT"` | `wav` | WAV encoding. Supported values are `FLOAT`, `PCM_16`, and `PCM_24`. |
| `flac_bit_depth` | `"PCM_24"` | `flac` | FLAC encoding depth. `PCM_24` writes 24-bit style samples; other values fall back to 16-bit behavior. |
| `mp3_bit_rate` | `"320k"` | `mp3` | MP3 bitrate passed to the encoder. |
| `m4a_bit_rate` | `"192k"` | `m4a` | M4A bitrate passed to the encoder. |
| `m4a_codec` | `"aac_at"` | `m4a` | M4A codec. If omitted, pymss uses `aac_at`. |
| `m4a_aac_at_quality` | `2` | `m4a` with `aac_at` | Apple AAC encoder quality option. |

## `inference_params`

`inference_params` overrides runtime inference settings after the model config is loaded. Most values default to the model YAML, so you usually only pass keys that you want to override.

### Naming Note: `standardize` vs `normalize`

There are two different normalization-related options:

| Public parameter | Meaning | Internal compatibility detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `standardize` | Old input standardization. The input mix is standardized before model inference and restored afterward. | Existing MSS YAML files store this switch as `inference.normalize`. pymss keeps that YAML key for compatibility, but exposes the public/API/CLI name as `standardize`. If `standardize` is `None`, pymss uses the YAML value. If the YAML key is missing, it is treated as `False`. |
| `normalize` | New output peak normalization. After separation, pymss computes one shared gain from the loudest selected output stem and applies that same gain to every returned/saved stem. | This is a pymss runtime parameter, not the old MSS YAML `inference.normalize`. The target peak is just below 0 dBFS (`-0.01 dBFS`). |

Use `standardize` when you want to control the model's old input standardization behavior. Use `normalize` when you want the saved/returned stems to be peak-normalized together.

### Common MSS Parameters

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `batch_size` | int \| `None` | Number of chunks processed together. Larger values can improve throughput but use more memory. |
| `overlap_size` | int \| `None` | MSS overlap size in samples/chunks according to the model implementation. Higher overlap can reduce boundary artifacts but costs more compute. |
| `chunk_size` | int \| `None` | Audio chunk size override. Larger chunks can improve continuity but require more memory. |
| `stem_batch_size` | int \| `None` | Splits output stems into smaller groups during `process_folder()` to reduce peak memory. `0` or missing disables stem batching. Ignored when output `normalize=True`, because linked normalization needs all saved stems together. |
| `standardize` | bool \| `None` | Controls legacy input standardization. `None` means use the model config value from YAML `inference.normalize`; missing YAML value becomes `False`. |
| `normalize` | bool | Enables linked output peak normalization to `-0.01 dBFS`. |
| `mask_mode` | str \| `None` | Mask mode for models that expose `set_mask_mode()`. |
| `enable_tta` | bool | Model/runtime TTA flag where supported. The top-level `use_tta` parameter is still the main API switch used by `MSSeparator`. |
| `cuda_attention_backend` | str \| `None` | CUDA attention backend for supported RoFormer-style modules. Valid values include `auto`, `default`, `flash`, `cudnn`, `efficient`, `math`, and `xformers`. |
| `mps_attention_backend` | str \| `None` | Apple MPS attention backend for supported modules. |
| `mps_mlx_min_tokens` | int \| `None` | Minimum token threshold used by the MPS/MLX attention path. |
| `mps_model_backend` | str \| `None` | Backend override for supported Apple Silicon model execution paths. |
| `mps_model_compute_dtype` | str \| `None` | Compute dtype for supported Apple Silicon model execution paths, for example `float16`. |
| `use_amp` | bool | Enables automatic mixed precision where the model/runtime supports it. |
| `fuse_conv_bn` | bool | Fuses convolution and batch normalization where supported. |
| `use_channels_last` | bool | Uses channels-last memory format where supported. |
| `shifts` | int \| `None` | Shift count for model families that support shift-based inference. |
| `split` | bool | Split inference flag for model families that support it. |
| `overlap` | float \| `None` | Fractional overlap used by model families that expose Demucs-style split inference. |

### VR Parameters

VR models do not use MSS YAML configs. pymss builds a VR runtime config internally and then applies supported overrides.

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `batch_size` | int | VR batch size. |
| `window_size` | int | VR window size. |
| `aggression` | int | Separation aggressiveness used by the VR backend. |
| `enable_tta` | bool | Enables VR TTA where supported. |
| `enable_post_process` | bool | Enables VR post-processing. |
| `post_process_threshold` | float | Threshold used by VR post-processing. |
| `high_end_process` | bool | Enables high-end processing in the VR backend. |
| `use_amp` | bool | Enables mixed precision where supported. |
| `fuse_conv_bn` | bool | Fuses convolution and batch normalization where supported. |
| `use_channels_last` | bool | Uses channels-last memory format where supported. |
| `mps_model_backend` | str \| `None` | Apple Silicon backend override where supported. |
| `mps_model_compute_dtype` | str \| `None` | Apple Silicon compute dtype override where supported. |
| `normalize` | bool | Enables linked output peak normalization for the VR primary and secondary stems. |

`standardize` is not meaningful for VR models.

## Inference And Saving Methods

### `process_folder(input_folder)`

Accepts either a single audio file path or a folder path. It loads audio, separates configured stems, saves outputs according to `store_dirs`, and returns a list of successfully processed input file names.

```python
success_files = separator.process_folder("songs")
```

If `input_folder` is a folder, every direct child file in that folder is considered an input candidate. The method does not recursively walk subfolders.

### `separate(mix, pbar=True, stems=None)`

Runs separation on an already-loaded audio array and returns a dictionary mapping stem name to audio array.

```python
results = separator.separate(mix, stems=["vocals", "instrumental"])
vocals = results["vocals"]
```

`stems` can be `None`, a single stem name, or an iterable of stem names. When `None`, all model stems are returned. When output `normalize=True`, normalization is computed only across the returned stems.

### `save_audio(audio, sr, file_name, store_dir)`

Writes one audio array using `output_format` and `audio_params`.

```python
separator.save_audio(results["vocals"], 44100, "song_vocals", "results")
```

### `close()`

Releases model references and clears backend caches where possible. Call this when a long-running process is done with a separator and wants to free memory deterministically.

```python
separator.close()
```

## Practical Examples

### Catalog Model With Output Normalization

```python
separator = MSSeparator.from_model_name(
    "bs_roformer_voc_hyperacev2",
    download=True,
    output_format="flac",
    inference_params={
        "normalize": True,
    },
)
separator.process_folder("input.wav")
```

### Custom MSS Weights With Input Standardization Override

```python
separator = MSSeparator(
    model_type="mel_band_roformer",
    model_path="models/custom.ckpt",
    config_path="models/custom.yaml",
    device="cuda",
    inference_params={
        "standardize": True,
        "normalize": False,
    },
)
```

### Save Only Selected Stems

```python
separator = MSSeparator.from_model_name(
    "some_six_stem_model",
    store_dirs={
        "vocals": "out/vocals",
        "drums": "out/drums",
    },
    inference_params={
        "normalize": True,
    },
)
```

Only `vocals` and `drums` are saved. With output normalization enabled, those two saved stems share one normalization gain.
